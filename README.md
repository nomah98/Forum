Interactive chat/text forum (No longer hosted by Northeastern Server)

This was a partner project created by Noah Rochefort and Elijah Steres in Fundamentals of Computer Science I at Northeastern University by
using a university owned server and their library, users could connect and chat with each other, in different view, edit and search modes.
The server is no longer running so it cannot be connected to and interacted with.
